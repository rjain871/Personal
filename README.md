# Personal
This project tracks my personal goals, methodologies, routines, and interests over time.

It resides in Github because Git (and source code management systems in general) excel at when and why changes were made, which is precisely what is desired here.

I'm tracking the following types of things:

    Goals I wish to achieve
    Methodologies and routines for doing things
    Preferences and favorites
